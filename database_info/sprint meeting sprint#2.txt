Sprint Retrospective
====================
1. We have 3 members and got 60 hours tasks, and we finished these tasks in our planning target.
2. In next sprint, we can define a task more detailed (like put a requirements list for each task)
 more detail of the taks to reduce the confusion of the definition of the taks
3. Every component is working well, the validation funciton on "update a stock item" page is not working so far due to a layout of code
4. Yes, in next sprint, a well-commentted code will help other team memebers to understand your code to help them develop additional functions faster.
